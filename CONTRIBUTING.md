Please run modified Bash scripts through `shellcheck` before making a pull request.
Please run modified Python scripts through `pylint` and `black` before making a pull request.
Like spell checkers, code linters aren't always right, but neither are we.

You can also test modified scripts through `time` to see how runtime is affected by changes.
